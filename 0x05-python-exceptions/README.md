# 0x05. Python - Exceptions

## oncept of the project Title
In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. When an exceptional situation arises, an object representing the exception is created, and the normal flow of the program is interrupted to handle the exception.

Exceptions can be raised (generated) by the Python interpreter or explicitly by the programmer. Common examples of exceptions include attempting to divide by zero, accessing an index that is out of range in a list, or trying to open a file that does not exist
